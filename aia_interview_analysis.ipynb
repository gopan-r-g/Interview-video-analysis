      "speaker 2: \"Women are my weakness. I have, when they see me like this, I think we should, before I start, before I start next month, when I start the job, you need to send an e-mail, company-wide e-mail, telling them that I'm about to start, because once I learn like this, everything just, they don't know how to act. They don't know how to act.\"\n",

      "speaker 2: \"That's why I say let me work from home. If I work from home, there won't be any of these issues. They can see me on Zoom. On Zoom like this, I turn off my camera on Zoom. Because if they see my face like this, we can't even have the productive meeting.\"\n",

      "speaker 2: \"Women are my weakness. I have, when they see me like this, I think we should, before I start, before I start next month, when I start the job, you need to send an e-mail, company-wide e-mail, telling them that I'm about to start, because once I learn like this, everything just, they don't know how to act. They don't know how to act.\"\n",

      "speaker 2: \"That's why I say let me work from home. If I work from home, there won't be any of these issues. They can see me on Zoom. On Zoom like this, I turn off my camera on Zoom. Because if they see my face like this, we can't even have the productive meeting.\"\n",
